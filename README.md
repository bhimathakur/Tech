## Description
Written in the PHP programming language, implemented the code for a supermarket checkout that calculates the total price of a number of items. 

In a normal supermarket, items for sale are identified using Stock Keeping Units, or ‘SKUs’. In our store, we’ll use individual letters of the alphabet (A, B, C, and so on) to represent these SKUs. Our goods are priced individually, however, some items are 
multi-priced: buy n of them, and they’ll cost you y instead.
